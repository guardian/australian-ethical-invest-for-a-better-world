        <p>Most of us would like to align our investments with our values and get healthy returns at the same time. It’s a win-win. Or a wind-wind, perhaps, if you’re into turbines. But what exactly is ethical investment?</p>
        <p>Ethical investing means the whole process must incorporate analysis on the broader impact of an investment, in addition to pure investment analysis. If it has a positive impact then it can be considered for investment. The opposite also holds: should a prospective investment have a negative impact, it won’t be on the list for consideration.</p>
        <p>The important thing to know is that you can invest with organisations whose values and ethical investment processes align with yours.</p>
        <p>You can choose which shares you hold or managed funds you invest in, and which super fund you are in: super fund <a href="#">Australian Ethical</a> has an ethical charter that guides the way it makes investments. This may, or may not, be just your ethical cup of tea.</p>

Just because it may be good for the planet doesn’t necessarily mean it will generate good stable returns forever. In fact, from our own experience, equity investments in renewables tend to be more volatile than the broader equity market due in large part to the industry being subject to government policies.</p>

      <!-- /c-title -->

      <div class="s-entry-content u-vertical-space">
        <p>Mainstream investors are increasingly seeing the financial benefit of ethical investment. In many situations, ethical investing aligns with financially prudent investing.</p>
        <p>For example, as the world transitions to a low-carbon economy, it may not make good financial or ethical sense to invest in industries that are high greenhouse gas emitters (such as the fossil fuel industry).</p>
        <p>That’s one reason why ‘responsible investing’ – which screens for environmental, social and governance and/or ethical factors – has more than quadrupled over the past three years, and a staggering 44% of Australian assets under management now use some form of responsible investment strategy.</p>
